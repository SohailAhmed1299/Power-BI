 # Project 1: Power-BI on Sales SuperMarket

  * I collected sales data from Kaggle.
  * Imported the data into Power BI and started cleaning it, removing duplicates and fixing errors. 
  * DAX language was used to make the data more accessible, and to create simple measures that would allow me to perform calculations with the data and display the   
    results in the visualizations.
  * Various visualizations were created according to the needs of the insights such as bar charts, pie charts, and tables to display the sales data.
  * Slicers and filters were implemented so users could interact with the data and customize their view of the dashboard.
  * Ensuring the dashboard was visually appealing, user-friendly, and provided clear insights into the sales data.
  * Created the interactive dashboard for my colleagues, who were impressed with the level of detail and interactivity of the dashboard.
  * Overall, the project gave me a deeper understanding of the sales data and provided the company with a valuable tool to make informed decisions.

 # Project 2: Power-BI on Sales Super store
  
 * To create a project on Power BI that focused on percentage change in sales data, I first gathered the necessary data from various sources, including sales reports   
   and customer purchase history. The data was then imported into Power BI, where I began the cleaning process to ensure that the data was accurate and consistent.
 * Next, I used various DAX formulas and measures to calculate the percentage change in sales data for the previous period. This involved creating calculations that        compared the current period's sales data to the previous period's sales data, and then presenting that information in a clear and easy-to-understand format.
 * Finally, I used the cleaned and calculated data to create an interactive dashboard that allowed users to easily explore and analyze the sales data. This included   
   creating visualizations such as charts and graphs that could be filtered and manipulated to provide a more in-depth understanding of the sales data.
Overall, the project involved a combination of data cleaning, DAX calculations, and dashboard creation to present sales data in a way that was both informative and user-friendly.

# Project 3: Revenue Comparison

In a recent Power BI project, I created a revenue comparison report that involved using various measures and DAX formulas to analyze and visualize sales data. I created a measure to calculate previous period sales and another measure to calculate the percentage change over the last period, which helped stakeholders understand how the business was performing over time. Additionally, I ranked the cities with the most sales using the RANKX function, which allowed stakeholders to easily identify the top-performing cities.

To make the visualization more appealing and understandable, I used tooltips that provided additional information about each data point when users hovered over them. This feature enhanced the user experience and allowed stakeholders to explore the data more easily.

 * Sales were highest in the Midwest region, followed by the West and East regions.
 * Sales increased by almost 5% over the previous period, indicating positive growth for the business.
 * The top-performing cities were Hyderabad, Pune, and New delhi, which accounted for 40% of total sales.

Overall, this project demonstrated the power of Power BI in analyzing and visualizing sales data. By using various measures, DAX formulas, and visualization techniques, I was able to provide valuable insights for the project to make a drive data-driven decision-making.

In total I made two sheet on Revenue comparison onw with the City being the primary zone and second sheet product being the primary part.

In first sheet we can infer that how trends are showing in the cities.

I used various tooltips to sjowcase the changes in more elobrate way so that the visuals can be more understandable

I used various measures adn DAX to detemine and create more understanble visulaiztion of the data.
