# Project 1: Power-BI on Sales Super store

 *I collected sales data from Kaggle.
 *Imported the data into Power BI and started cleaning it, removing duplicates and fixing errors.
 *DAX language was used to make the data more accessible, and to create simple measures that would allow me to perform calculations with the data and display the results   in the visualizations.
 *Various visualizations were created according to the needs of the insights such as bar charts, pie charts, and tables to display the sales data.
 *Slicers and filters were implemented so users could interact with the data and customize their view of the dashboard.
 *Ensuring the dashboard was visually appealing, user-friendly, and provided clear insights into the sales data.
 *Created the interactive dashboard for my colleagues, who were impressed with the level of detail and interactivity of the dashboard.
 *Overall, the project gave me a deeper understanding of the sales data and provided the company with a valuable tool to make informed decisions.
